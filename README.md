# Web Guesser
Uses Sinatra and Ruby to create a web-based number-guessing game.

The game randomly selects a secret number 1-100 then asks the player to guess. If the guess is more than 5 away from the actual number, a message appears saying the guess is "way too high" or "way too low." If the guess is within 5 of the secret number the message will simply say "too high" or "too low." If the guess is correct the game will provide a win message and the secret number will be revealed.

*Have fun!*
